# Plan 1 – Hero Section Layout

## AI Prompt
I asked an AI assistant how to structure and style a hero section
with headline, call-to-action button and background gradient.

## AI Plan Summary
The AI suggested:
- A clear headline and subheading

adjusted typography, spacing, and added a soft gradient background.
